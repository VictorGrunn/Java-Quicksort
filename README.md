Java-Quicksort
==============

A simple, direct implementation of Java Quicksort.

Coded by Victor Grunn/Joseph Antolick, though of course I didn't come up with QuickSort!

Just a basic and simple example project, done in a flash (with some debugging, I admit)
to show off some supremely basic Java skills. The included jar simply gives a Swing
window showing the initial array and the resulting array, along with an estimate of the
amount of time it took to complete the process.
